# create the venv, this only has to be done once. 
# the name my_p3_env can be changed, it is just the label for the venv.
# once it's created, you can just re-activate it using the command below:
# depending on what your python 3 command is:
# python3 -m venv my_p3_env
# or
python -m venv my_p3_env

# activate the venv
source my_p3_env/bin/activate

# use pip to install the minimum requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt


# run the main app:
python Main.py

# or one of the examples
